					Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently studying Frontend

					the use of libraries and frameworks such as React and Sass.
					I am also learning to design and implement user
					interfaces(UI) and optimizing its use for better user
					experience(UX). Since before I have also worked quite alot

					editing. <br></br>
